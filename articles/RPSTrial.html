            RPS (rock, paper, scissors) Speed Trial is an easy to learn but difficult to master game. Created in Python, the game uses Google's Mediapipe library to track the player's hands and interpret whether they're holding up rock, paper, or scissors.

        <p>
            The game presents the player with their "opponent's" hand (rock, paper, or scissors) and a condition they must meet (win, lose, or tie). When the player makes the correct pose, the game returns how long (in seconds) it took for the player to make that pose and starts the next round.

            The game lasts 5 rounds. At the end of the game, a total of how long it took from each round is displayed.
