            RPS (rock, paper, scissors) Speed Trial is an easy to learn but difficult to master game. Created in Python, the game uses Google's Mediapipe library to track the player's hands and interpret whether they're holding up rock, paper, or scissors.

        <p>
            The game presents the player with their "opponent's" hand (rock, paper, or scissors) and a condition they must meet (win, lose, or tie). When the player makes the correct pose, the game returns how long (in seconds) it took for the player to make that pose and starts the next round.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            The game lasts 5 rounds. At the end of the game, a total of how long it took from each round is displayed.

            My inspiration for this game was one of the minigames from Brain Age DS. The game plays the same as RPS Speed Trial except that you speak your hand (rock, paper, or scissors) into the DS microphone. I figured it wouldn't be too hard to recreate the game using a camera.
